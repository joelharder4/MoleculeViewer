##### Nightmare Mode
I did it. (Yay)

##### Compiling
to compile the _molecule library (including swig) use the command: `make`. 
for an extra layer of assurance, I use: `make clean` beforehand but it is not necessary

##### Running
to run the server use the command `python3 server.py port#` where 'port#' is the port you want to host it on.
